## 🛠️ Data Cleaning  

Before diving into analysis, we cleaned the data for consistency and relevance:  
1. **Dropped Irrelevant Columns**: Removed unnecessary columns to focus on meaningful attributes.  
2. **Handled Duplicates**: Removed duplicate rows based on `Coaster_Name`, `Location`, and `Opening_Date`.  
3. **Renamed Columns**: Ensured columns had clear, consistent names.  
4. **Filtered Missing Values**: Dropped rows with significant missing values to maintain accuracy.
